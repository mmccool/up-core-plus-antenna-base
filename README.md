# UP Core Plus Antenna Base
Base for Aaeon UP Core Plus to mount WiFi antennas.
3D Printable.  Can work with either stick-on flat internal antennas or
external RP-SMA antennas. Note that you need antennas and\or RP-SMA
adapters with the smaller MHF4 connectors.
Also provides space to mount RTC battery
and protects bottom of the board.
To mount, at least four but preferrably six M2.5 x 8 bolts,
assuming the 9mm spacers that come with the board are used.
